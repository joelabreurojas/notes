# Personal Knowledge Base

### Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for capturing and structuring information across multiple domains. It is a personal knowledge management system designed for efficient learning, quick reference, and the long-term storage of notes, summaries, and important concepts.

### Guiding Principles

- **Categorized & Organized:** Notes are grouped into broad, numbered directories to keep topics distinct and the repository easy to navigate.
- **Simple & Scalable:** The structure is designed to be simple enough for quick lookups but scalable enough to accommodate new subjects without becoming cluttered.
- **Future-Proof & Portable:** Using plain-text Markdown ensures that these notes are not locked into any proprietary application and will remain accessible for years to come.

### How to Add New Notes

To maintain a consistent structure when adding content:

1.  **Identify the Category:** Find the most relevant top-level directory for the new note. If a suitable one doesn't exist, create a new numbered folder (e.g., `10-new-topic/`).
2.  **Create the File:** Add a new Markdown file (`.md`) to the appropriate directory.
3.  **Use Descriptive Naming:** Name the file using `kebab-case` (e.g., `my-new-topic-notes.md`) to keep filenames clean and URL-friendly.
