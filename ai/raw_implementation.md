# RAG from Scratch Without Frameworks

## 1. RAG from Scratch without any Frameworks

 This demonstrates how to build a basic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from the ground up, without relying on high-level frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex. It would probably cover the fundamental steps involved, such as loading and indexing documents, retrieving relevant context based on a query, and then using a language model to generate a response conditioned on the retrieved information. This approach helps in understanding the core mechanics of RAG.

  Provides a concise implementation of a basic RAG pipeline, possibly highlighting the essential code snippets required to perform the core RAG operations in a minimal setup.

  While mentioning LangChain and LlamaIndex, likely delves into more advanced RAG techniques, specifically focusing on the integration of ColBERT for retrieval. ColBERT is a method for efficient and effective passage search. Even though frameworks are mentioned, the underlying concepts of advanced RAG and ColBERT would be valuable for understanding improvements beyond basic "from scratch" implementations.

## 2. RAG From Scratch: Conversational RAG Without LangChain or LlamaIndex

Expands on the "RAG from scratch" concept by focusing on building a conversational RAG system without using LangChain or LlamaIndex. Conversational RAG involves maintaining context over multiple turns of dialogue, allowing the system to answer follow-up questions and refer back to previous parts of the conversation. The video would probably cover how to manage conversation history and incorporate it into the retrieval and generation steps in a basic implementation.
